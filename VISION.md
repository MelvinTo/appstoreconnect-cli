# Our Vision

_AppStoreConnect CLI_ automates the process of interacting with Apple Appstore Connect. Including user and access management, TestFlight, reporting, and provisioning.

_AppStoreConnect CLI_ provides a simple, easy to use command-line interface that is easily scriptable and supports automated workflows and infrastructure-as-code.

_AppStoreConnect CLI_ is a single binary executable, written in Swift for Swift developers. Objective-C devs, we still ❤️ you.

_AppStoreConnect CLI_ will not duplicate the functionality provided by Apple's existing command-line developer tools. Eg, `xcodebuild`, `altool`, `codesign`, etc. It will instead seek to integrate with and work alongside these tools.

_AppStoreConnect CLI_ adopts the [Unix philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy) of:

- Programs that do one thing and do it well.
- Programs that work together.
- Programs that handle text streams, because that is a universal interface.

_AppStoreConnect CLI_ will continue to evolve, in a measured way that extends its functionality to make it an indespensable tool for developers delivering apps on Apple's AppStore.

## _AppStoreConnect CLI_'s Relationship with [Itty Bitty Apps](https://ittybittyapps.com)

Itty Bitty Apps is an Apple (and Android) focused application development consultancy. We've built [other great tools](https://revealapp.com) for iOS developers.

Itty Bitty Apps recognizes that the Apple developer community needs better tools. _AppStoreConnect CLI_ is one of our contributions to ensuring the community has those tools.

Itty Bitty Apps intends to keep _AppStoreConnect CLI_ open source and available as a standalone development tool.
