# Our Vision

`appstoreconnect-cli` automates the process of interacting with Apple Appstore Connect. Including user and access management, TestFlight, reporting, and provisioning.

`appstoreconnect-cli` provides a simple, easy to use command-line interface that is easily scriptable and supports automated workflows and infrastructure-as-code.

`appstoreconnect-cli` is a single binary executable, written in Swift for Swift developers. Objective-C devs, we still ❤️ you.

`appstoreconnect-cli` will not duplicate the functionality provided by Apple's existing command-line developer tools. Eg, `xcodebuild`, `altool`, `codesign`, etc. It will instead seek to integrate with and work alongside these tools.

`appstoreconnect-cli` adopts the [Unix philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy) of:

- Programs that do one thing and do it well.
- Programs that work together.
- Programs that handle text streams, because that is a universal interface.

`appstoreconnect-cli` will continue to evolve, in a measured way that extends its functionality to make it an indespensable tool for developers delivering apps on Apple's AppStore.

Itty Bitty Apps recognizes that the Apple developer community needs better tools. `appstoreconnect-cli` is one of our contributions to ensuring the community has those tools.

Itty Bitty Apps intends to keep `appstoreconnect-cli` open source and available as a standalone development tool.
